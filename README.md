# Icon System

* All icons are svg
* Put icons in src/assets/icons folder. 
* Use **dash** instead of **underscore** to separate words in icon name
* Command to create sprite is - **npm run buildSprite**
* Icons sprite file is automatically loaded in base.pug - hence in all pages
* Use **srs/blocks/library/icon** mixin to show icon
